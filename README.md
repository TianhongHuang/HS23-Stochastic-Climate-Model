# Stochastic-Climate-Model
This repo shares the code accomplished simulation of an idealized climate model with spatiotemporal stochastic clouds and planetary-scale circulation, which illustrates study of climate-change problems, changes in cloud cluster statistics, Walker circulations and extreme rainfall events.
