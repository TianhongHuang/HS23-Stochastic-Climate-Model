# Stochastic-Climate-Model
This repo shares the code accomplished simulation of an idealized climate model with spatiotemporal stochastic clouds and planetary-scale circulation, which illustrates study of climate-change problems, changes in cloud cluster statistics, Walker circulations and extreme rainfall events.

# Contains
- `HS23_FORTRAN/`: Fortran codes that simulating model SH23 and generating outputs file.
- `HS23_MATLAB/`: Matlab codes that collecting all output data and visualizing data by plotting various figures. 

# Reference
This program is based on author's reseach publicated on Phys Rev Fluids [reference](https://journals.aps.org/prfluids/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevFluids.7.010502), one can seek for the details of model descriptions and numerical setup in above link.

# Guidelines 
One can look at `README2.md` for further guidelines during process of operating simulations.
